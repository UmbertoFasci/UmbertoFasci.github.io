## D3.js Embedding in Jekyll

Below is a plot that has been embedded via the Observable platform. This is an attempt to orient future data visualization away from image assets hosted via github to embedded iframes hosted by observable.

<iframe width="100%" height="371" frameborder="0"
  src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@umbertofasci/jekylltestplot@61?cells=plot"></iframe>

Updated plot aesthetics to match the blog, and it seems that the iframe height has to be adjusted accordingly with each plot that is embedded.
Every time, the plot is updated on Observable one must export the iframe code to update jekyll.

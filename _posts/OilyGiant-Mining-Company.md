# Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the volume of oil reserves for new wells in each region. This model will help select the top-performing oil wells based on predicted reserves and identify the region with the highest profit margin. The modelâ€™s output will guide the decision on where to drill, considering both profitability and financial risk.

For the purpose of understanding the main structure of the following analysis, I have taken a modular approach to each of the sections and subsections. Creating functions to perform the modeling, analysis all with defined output structure in order to further utilize the resulting information.

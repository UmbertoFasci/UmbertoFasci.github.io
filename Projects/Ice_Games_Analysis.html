<hr>
<p>When looking at unique entries based on the <code>Name</code> of the game and the <code>Platform</code> it was released on. There appears to be <strong>16709</strong> out of <strong>16715</strong> entries which are unique. Looking at the duplicated entries based on <code>Name</code> and <code>Platform</code>, we can make several notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need for Speed: Most Wanted</strong>: Upon investigation this title had two separate release dates <code>2005</code> and <code>2012</code>. For whatever the reason is, these are not in fact <em>duplicates</em> but two separate games. However, specifying the release date in the <code>name</code> feature of these titles will help to deliniate them from each other. At least when it comes to comparing both <code>name</code> and <code>platform</code>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>The two <strong>Need for Speed: Most Wanted</strong> games were released by separate developers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted" class="external" target="_blank">Wikipedia Source</a></p>
</div></div><ul>
<li><strong>NaN</strong>: These NaN entries in the <strong>GEN</strong> platform will be appropriately handled in the following stage.</li>
<li><strong>Madden NFL 13</strong>: At first glance this may seem a simple duplication error. However, there might be an explaination for this considering Madden NFL 13 had different regional release dates within 2012. However, the sales data associated with entry <code>16230</code> seems to be associated with the EU release. Combining the entries together via <code>EU_sales</code> should resolve this data issue while incorporating this data.</li>
<li><strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong>: Similar to Madden NFL 13 there are several releases associated with the title throughout several global regions. Entry <code>4127</code> seems to be associated with the EU release in <em>2007</em>. Combining the entries together via <code>EU_sales</code> should resolve this data issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here all the columns are transformed into a lowercase format. As for the <strong>tbd</strong> entries in <code>user_score</code>, they are neatly handled by coercing the values to numeric. This forced the <strong>tbd</strong> values to simply become NaN.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>For <code>rating</code> I had considered utilizing the <strong>IGDB API</strong> to pull in potential ratings for each title missing a rating. However, since this is a Jupyter notebook submission; there is no real way to handle the secrets associated with performing requests on this API. If there is I would appreciate some advice on this topic.</p>
</div></div><p>Handling the missing data of features that can’t be handled otherwise must occur before any of the imputation techniques we wish to employ. For this reason, entries with missing data in <code>year_of_release</code> and/or <code>rating</code> were dropped.</p>

<p>When considering the top 5 platforms determined by total sales (Million USD), the time-range <code>2000-2015</code> is shown to contain this data. Therefore, <code>2000-2015</code> represents the range in time with the highest density of sales by platform. Within this range of time there is an expressed pattern where <code>2000-2003</code> represents <strong>PS2</strong> has the highest and only performing platform when comparing to the rest of the top performing platforms. This suggests that <strong>PS2</strong> not only was the first amongst this group of filtered data to release, but maintained it’s position at the top until its last year of sales in <code>2010</code>. Despite this, the <strong>PS2</strong> platform remains the highest grossing in terms of total video game sales. Continuing with the remaining Play Station platform, the <strong>PS3</strong> released 2006 and expressed the highest median total sales that same year.</p>

<p>The most noticeable point alone and uniquely large given it’s lifespan value, is the <strong>PC</strong> platform. This is easily explainable as the “PC” is being represented in an immutable manner, like the rest of the platforms. With <strong>PS2, PS3, and PS4</strong> being represented appropriately, the differences between the platforms are shown. The game released for the PC in 1985 and the games released in 2016 for the PC are not for the same <strong>PC</strong>. That is why it is overly represented in this particular metric.</p>

<p>We already determined the significant range of time for video game sales on the whole. However, for building a model to inform upon strategies for <strong>2017</strong> we must make sure to restrict the time range to a point where we are not capturing outdated patterns. In this case, <strong>2013 and onward</strong> will be utilized to inform upon <strong>2017</strong> strategies.</p>

<p>The top 5 performing platforms in the updated time range remains the same unsurprisingly. With PS2 in the lead and PS3 also being presented. Expanding on the top performing range to 6 will provide more data relevant for modeling 2017. In this range PS2 is no longer included however, it is superceeded by the PS4 in this range acting as the top performer.</p>

<p>As expressed in the above graph, <strong>X360</strong> had a complete market share in NA and EU however not in JP (affected by top 5 restriction). <strong>PS2</strong> has nearly equal distributed market share throughout each region of interest, with a slight increased share in JP. <strong>Wii</strong> held a farely small percentage, however experienced its greatest share in NA. <strong>PS3</strong> was most popular in EU. The <strong>DS</strong> platform was most popular in JP. In fact was the most popular platform in JP. Looking at only the top 5 platforms grouped by region affected the representation of <strong>PS</strong> in NA and EU, only being represented in the JP regional top 5 platforms.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>When looking at the data as a whole, there is much that can be derived. In terms of <strong>data preperation and preprocessing</strong> handling the implicit duplicates was an essential step in insuring accurate analysis. Especially when it comes to differentiating games which shared the same name yet were released at different times amongst separate platforms. Additionally, handling the data types to ensure the reasonable expression of year time data was a required action given the original data representation.</p>
<p>Continuing with the analysis, most of the analytical structures and directions revolved around the <code>total_sales</code> variable created via the summation of relevant regional sale values for every entry. The further grouping and aggregation by platform, genre, and rating were all done separately to avoid the doupling of aggregations. When attempting the <strong>zero sales</strong> analysis from the scope of <code>total_sales</code> there was no potential to derive any further value from it. Since in a global scale there is not a single platform that is not expressing a sale. Perhaps further analysis on a regional scale can be completed on the same topic.</p>
<p>On the same thread, reviewing the top 5 and 6 performing platforms revealed a consistent range of time from 2000 - 2016 where all of the top performing platforms by global sales where expressed. This allowed the previous years to be disregarded in further analysis.</p>
<p>On the whole, there is a clear trend in Play Station platforms and each of their respective global sales performance. While expressing the greatest global markest share as a platform there is no doubt that investment in title development for future Play Station platforms would be the most profitable. Additionally, investment in Play Station titles under the Action genre would be most advisable considering it’s global market share. Targeted game development for Role-Playing titles can be accomplished successfuly in Japan.</p>
<p>In addition to the main analysis for 2017 campaign strategies. The hypothesis tested regarding the potential equity between Xbox One and PC user ratings showed that the averages are in fact different. Also, there are no significant difference in the average user rating between Action and Sports genres. Therefore, one could conclude that user ratings had little to no affect in the clear significant difference between the genres’ market share.</p>
